The model will be trained on dermoscopic images, leveraging efficient image processing and encryption to create a comprehensive and secure diagnostic tool.

Introduction
Skin cancer is among the most prevalent forms of cancer, with melanoma being the most lethal due to its aggressive nature. Early and accurate detection is essential, as timely diagnosis significantly improves treatment outcomes and survival rates. However, traditional diagnostic methods, such as clinical examinations and biopsies, are time-intensive and often reliant on the expertise of dermatologists, resulting in delays in diagnosis and treatment.
The advent of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly deep learning, has revolutionized medical diagnostics. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a specialized type of AI model, have shown remarkable success in accurately classifying skin lesions from dermoscopic images. These advancements reduce diagnostic times, improve accuracy, and provide critical support to clinicians.
Despite these advantages, integrating AI into healthcare presents significant challenges, particularly concerning data privacy and security. Medical images, being highly sensitive, are susceptible to unauthorized access and breaches. While traditional data security measures provide protection, they often come at the cost of degrading the performance of AI models, leading to a trade-off between privacy and efficiency.
This research addresses these challenges by proposing a novel cryptographic framework that ensures the confidentiality and integrity of patient data while maintaining high diagnostic accuracy. The framework leverages homomorphic encryption to enable secure processing of encrypted data and incorporates blockchain technology to establish transparency and trust in the diagnostic process.
The proposed system integrates advanced cryptographic techniques with a CNN-based diagnostic model, providing a secure and efficient solution for automated skin cancer detection. Using a dataset from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC), the model is trained to classify multiple types of skin lesions. This integration of state-of-the-art AI and cryptographic methods marks a significant advancement in the development of privacy-preserving and reliable diagnostic tools for clinical use. Challenges in Traditional Skin Cancer Diagnosis:
?Time Dependency: Diagnostic methods like dermoscopy and biopsy rely heavily on expert interpretation, often causing delays.
?Access Limitations: Many regions face a shortage of specialists, leading to prolonged diagnostic timelines.
?Inconsistencies: Variability in expert assessments can impact the accuracy of diagnoses.



This research makes several key contributions. It introduces a privacy-preserving diagnostic framework that combines homomorphic encryption with CNNs, ensuring secure data processing without compromising diagnostic accuracy. Blockchain integration provides a transparent and immutable record of diagnostic processes, enhancing trust and accountability. A custom CNN architecture has been developed to achieve high accuracy in classifying dermoscopic images, tailored specifically for clinical applications. Comprehensive testing and validation have been conducted on ISIC datasets to address both performance and security concerns. Furthermore, the framework demonstrates a balance between performance and privacy, showcasing the feasibility of using advanced cryptographic techniques without diminishing AI efficiency. Comparison with Existing Approaches: 
?Unlike traditional methods that prioritize either privacy or performance, the proposed framework achieves a balance using homomorphic encryption.
?Blockchain integration adds an extra layer of trust absent in most current AI diagnostic systems.
?The framework improves scalability, accuracy, and security while adhering to ethical standards in healthcare.
